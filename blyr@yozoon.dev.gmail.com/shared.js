 * paradoxxxzero. The extension windows-blur-effect written by Luca Viggiani 
 * gave me lots of useful information about the general structure of GNOME Shell 
 * extensions and connection callbacks. gnome-shell-shader-extension by Florian 
 * Mounier showed me how to implement custom GLSL Shaders as Clutter Effects.
